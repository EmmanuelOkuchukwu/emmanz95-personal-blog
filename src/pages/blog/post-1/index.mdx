## My Headline

Welcome to my first post. My name is Emmanuel Okuchukwu, and I'm an aspiring front-end developer. I am a born-again believer who is always looking to the bible about things that are happening in the world around us today. I have a strong urge to use my ever-growing knowledge of tech and software engineering to help advance the Kingdom of God in a mighty away. In this website you can find out information about some projects that I have done, and you can find out me about me as well and finally you can get in contact with in multiple methods such as Instagram, LinkedIn and so on. Thank you for stopping by and checking out my blog and also stay tuned for more blogs to come in the future. I also will be uploading a lot of posts about Jesus Christ and the coming kingdom so if you are interested in that please stay tuned and if not, I will be uploading posts about tech so don't worry, but it would really do you some good if you were to read some posts about Jesus Christ and the good news of the Gospel.
